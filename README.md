# Quick Writing to LaTeX

This is a converter created to make writing easier when writing mathematical and logical statements. This program was made to not have to constantly remember some specific keyworkds in LaTeX.

Currently made for my logics class notes, but in the future I'm probably going to expand it for more general math writing.

## Current list of keywords

|Symbol|LaTeX|Keyword for fast conversion|Notes|

|$\text{text}$|\text{}|#[...]|used to write text|
|$\models$|\models|#\|=||
|$\neg$|\neg|#not|logical not|
|$\wedge$|\wedge|#and||
|$\vee$|\vee|#or||
|$\rightarrow$|\rightarrow|#->|if ... then ...|
|$\leftarrow$|\leftarrow|#<-||
|$\leftrightarrow$|\leftrightarrow|#<->|if and only if|
|$\exists$|\exists|#E||
|$\forall$|\forall|#A||
|$\not$|\not|#!|generic not for chars|

## Possible changes

- **\iff** is usally used to write $\iff$
- **\implies** is usually used to write $\implies$
